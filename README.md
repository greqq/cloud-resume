# Cloud Resume Challenge Project

## Overview

This repository is part of the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/). The challenge encompasses various aspects of software development and cloud infrastructure, including front-end development, back-end services, cloud infrastructure provisioning, and CI/CD processes.

This specific repository contains the front-end component of my cloud resume project, implemented using Next.js. It is a simple, one-page application that serves as my online resume.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main repositories:

1. **Frontend (Current Repository):** This Next.js application represents the user interface of the cloud resume. It is hosted at [https://webflowprojects.cc/](https://webflowprojects.cc/), showcasing the final, deployed resume.

2. **Backend Infrastructure:** The cloud infrastructure necessary for hosting and supporting the backend services is defined as code using Terraform. You can find the repository here: [Terraform Infrastructure](https://github.com/greqq/terraform-aws-infrastructure). It includes the AWS resources required for the project, such as S3 buckets, CloudFront distribution, and more.

3. **Lambda Function for Visitor Count:** A Lambda function designed to increment and retrieve a visitor count displayed on the resume. The code for this function is available at [Lambda Function](https://github.com/greqq/aws-cloud-resume-lambda).
